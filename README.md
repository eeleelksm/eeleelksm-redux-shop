# React-Redux Store

## Description

Shop Shop is an e-commerce app that allows the users to login in, shop for many different items, add them to a shopping cart, decreasing and increasing the quantities, checkout out their shopping cart and even view their order history. This application was then refactored using Redux.

This application was built using Node.js, GraphQL, Apollo Server, React, Redux, and MongoDB.

## User Story

`AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform`

`I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API`

`SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem`
